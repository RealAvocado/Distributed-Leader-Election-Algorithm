#Ring of Rings Algorithm Implementation
# Getting started
##1. IDE version: Intellij IDEA 2021.2
##2. SDK: JKD1.8.0_301
##3. How to run:
### 3.1 Task 3.1
### Class *SingleRingDemo* is the implementation of task *3.1*. In this demo there is a user-interaction interface. It will tell you to enter the number of processors and display the ring initialized. Then it will let you choose to show the whole procedure or just the final result. In summary, run the main method and just follow its instructions.
### 3.2 Task 3.2
### Class *RingOfRingsDemo* is the implementation of task *3.2*. This demo is more complicated and there's also a user-interaction interface. It will guide you to decide the number of total rings and the amount of processors in each ring. Then it will tell you to choose the type of id distribution of rings. Finally, it let you choose to show the whole procedure or just the final result. Just run the main method and following the instructions would be fine.
## 4. Content of the program
### Node class is the processor model. Ring class is the model of ring-network. LCR_Algorithm class is some implementation about leader-election procedure in the ring or ring-of-rings network. They are quite straightforward to understand with annotations.
